### Were your predictions accurate?

My prediction was that Hanging out with friends would have the highest enjoyment. This was accurate, as the output showed 'Hanging out with friends' as the activity with high enjoyment. I thought 'learning' or 'entertainment' would be the most frequent category. The analysis showed 'entertainment' was the most common category, which was accurate. I preditcted 'evening' activities would have the most enjoyment and 'afternoon' activities would have higher hours spent. My code revealed that for 'evening' activities, the average enjoyment was 8.5, which supported my prediction about enjoyment. The total hours spent on 'learning' activities was 7.5, which aligns with my expectation that homework (learning) would result to higher hours.

### What surprised you about your week?

I wouldn't say anything suprised me about my week, I feel that I am living pattern with work, and my extra activities, I do follow the same routine weekly with slight varitions,and I do more than just one activity a day so this assingment limmiting to just one object a day ddint feel entirely accurate to me since I just had to pick the highest option ever day. 

### Which higher order function was most useful and why?

The `filter` function was the most useful for this assignment. It selected specific parts of the data, like certain activity categories or times of day. This was helpful for getting specific information from the week's activities.
